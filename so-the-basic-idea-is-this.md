So the basic idea is this...

I plan on using this a website to publicly record (and keep track of) all the projects I am working on.
Whether or not this is a good idea...who knows. Whether or not I'll actually keep it updated...can't say.

Basically, I want to use one (or two, or just very few) tags for each post and be consistent in their use.
Each tag will correspond to the project with which that post is associated.
This way the tags can act as directory (or channels to speak in IRC terms) for my projects.

As you can see this post is tagged **general-update** which from now on should be how I tag any kind
of general update. This was chosen because it makes sense (also I just like two word phrases where the first word is "general").
My hope is that I can continue to make sense with my tag choices so I don't have to go back and change old posts to match a new
tag. Maybe I can do something with the `./config` file to control tag usage or add more actual webpages. 
Or I could just use a real static site generator? 

Tags: general-update, static-site
