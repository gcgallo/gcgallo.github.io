<p>This probably won't be any different. But it is a categorically provable
fact that 90 percent of programming textbooks, articles, papers, and 
courses are absolutely terrible. It is also a categorically provable fact 
that every single one of those textbooks, articles, papers, or videos begins
with a spiel about how this one is different from the rest.</p>

<p>That's why this attempt at building a guided tour of a programming
language began with the sentence, "This probably won't be any different",
because despite all my intentional aversions, I will most likely
fall into the same punji pits that trap other programming resources.
But this phrase carries double meaning. At least, for me, every time
I bear witness to a new programming language, I say to myself.
"This probably won't be any different." Of course, I later discover,
that it is quite different from other languages in non-trivial ways,
but my initial sentiment never changes. No matter how you approach a
language, you will always carry the baggage of some previous language.
(This statement was left intentionally general, as it applies to all languages.
I would think it quite right to say that your first human language has a 
great deal of impact on how you learn your first programming language
[citation needed].)</p>

<p>My intial rant was triggered by the idea that textbooks (among other 
resources) are often curated by individuals who know too much about
their chosen topic. This typically results in two possible types of
books. Either one that assumes far too much or not enough.</p>
