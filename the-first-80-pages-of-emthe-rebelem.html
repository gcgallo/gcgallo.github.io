<p>summary-of/commentary-on/quotes-from Albert Camus' <em>The Rebel</em></p>

<p><strong>Foreword</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>"All revolutions in modern times... have led to the reinforcement of the power of the State..."  </p></li>
<li><p>"The strange and terrifying growth of the modern State can be considered as the logical conclusion of inordinate technical and philosophical ambitions, foreign to the true spirit of rebellion..."</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assumes an understanding of absurdist reasoning as utilized to address the question of suicide, which is further discussed in his essay, <em>Myth of Sisyphus</em>.  </p></li>
<li><p>In a lonely world (Nietzsche's metaphysical desert), the issue of suicide suffices as the ultimate question of existence, but in a populated world, one must question the legitimacy of murder. This will be the main concern of <em>The Rebel</em></p></li>
<li><p>End of intro, "Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is."  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Rebel</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is a rebel? Someone who says enough is a enough. A slave pushed to the limit by their master. Someone who sympathizes with the oppressed. Really a rebel is someone who is willing to risk "All or Nothing" in order to be treated as an equal. To rebel is to risk death in favor of rights/values/ideals that one considers more important than their individual existence.   </p></li>
<li><p>"I rebel. We exist"  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Metaphysical Rebellion</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In physical sense, rebellion involves protesting against ones condition in relation to society. In the metaphysical sense, rebellion involves protesting against ones condition within all creation.  </li>
<li>"The metaphysical rebel protests against the condition in which he finds himself as a man"  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sons of Cain</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>"The history of rebellion has far more to do with the children of Cain than with the discples of Prometheus."  </p></li>
<li><p>Epicurus and Lucretius, early rebels, attempt to build ramparts around the world, <em>Maenia Mundi</em> in order to rebuke death, defy the gods, and silence hope.  </p></li>
<li><p>These ideas give rise to a personal god, as opposed to the Greek idea of nature being god.  </p></li>
<li><p>Cain = first crime = first rebellion = first murder  </p></li>
<li><p>"Thus the ground will be prepared for the great offensive against a hosilte heaven."  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Absolute Negation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Presents ideas of Marquis de Sade and the dandy Romantics that followed him.  </p></li>
<li><p>The favorite poem of the Romantics was <em>Paradise Lost</em>. They were quite preoccupied with Lucifer  </p></li>
<li><p>Blake on Milton, "he was a real poet...on the the side of the demons without knowing it." (modern examples, Kendrick's DAMN., Frank Ocean's "Nikes")   </p></li>
<li><p>Literature of damnation, "I was conscious of my power, I was conscious of my chains."  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rejection of Salvation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Makes me want to read some Dostoyevsky  </p></li>
<li><p>Romantics only wanted to equal God, Dostoyevsky's character Karamazov seeks to usurp God.  </p></li>
<li><p>Karamazov, "if truth exists, it is unacceptable because it is unjust."   </p></li>
<li><p>"tower of Babel, which is constructed...not to reach to the heavens, but to bring the heavens down to earth" </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Absolute Affirmation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>"God is denied in the name of justice, but can the idea of justice be understood without God" is this not the realm of absurdity  </p></li>
<li><p>Without God, "man must resolve to act, in order to exist.   </p></li>
<li><p>"Stirner laughs in his blind alley; Nietzsche beats his head against the wall"   </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nietzsche and Nihilism</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>To be forever misunderstood, "Nietzsche did not form a prohect to kill God. He found Him dead in the soul of his contemporaries.    </p></li>
<li><p>Nietzsche shows concern for uncontrolled, undirected rebellion, which could lead to apocalypse   </p></li>
<li><p>"Socialism is only a degenerate form of Christianity...Socialism is nihilistic..A nihilist is not one who believes in nothing, but one who does not beleive in what exists"  </p></li>
<li><p>"One must accept the unacceptable and hold to the unteneable...Thus from absolute despair will spring infinite joy, from blind servitude, unbounded freedom. To be free is precisely to abolish ends...Total acceptance of total necessity is his paradoxical definition of freedom."  </p></li>
<li><p>Absolute negation leads to the deification of crime and the individual. "Absolute affirmation leads to universalising murder and mankind simultaneously."  </p></li>
</ul>
